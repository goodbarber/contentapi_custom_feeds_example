Every GoodBarber account has now <strong>a great web app</strong>, in addition to the native app for iPhone and the native app for Android! <br /> <br /> While the iPhone app is written in objective C, the Android app is written in java, this web app is written in HTML5. The web app runs on every browser, no matter the phone or the OS you use, that is to say that, now, your readers on Windows Phone or Blackberry can access your content from their mobile phone.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> The <strong>web app is truly fantastic</strong>. It has the same look and feel as the native app. Our engineers made a great job because it was a big challenge to obtain such a result. Why? Because contrary to many app builders who run HTML5 apps encapsulated in a native shell, we decided to make the opposite. We looked at the native apps generated by GoodBarber and we ask our engineers to reproduce the same in HTML5. When you know GoodBarber's passion for native apps and the elaborated features and UX we provide in our apps, you assess the challenge :) <br /> </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">A sub-domain for your web app</p> <div class=\"texte\"> Now that you have <strong>a great web app</strong>, it's time for your users to use it. Your natives apps are distributed in the App Store and in Google Play. But what about the web app? <br /> <br /> By default, your web app is located on http://&lt;appname&gt;.goodbarber.com/m/.&nbsp;Since <strong>Goodbarber Salvador</strong>, you can change this URL and choose your own. <br /> <br /> For instance, you can decide to link your web app to <strong>http://m.yourdomain.com</strong>&nbsp;That will be far more convinient for your users to access your html5 web app, right ? <br /> <br /> To do so, connect to your backend and go to Publication &gt; Submission &gt; HTML5 and decide which subdomain you want to link your web app to. <br /> </div> <div class=\"photo bottom\" style=\"text-align:center\"> <a href=\"http://blog.goodbarber.com/photo/art/grande/5920929-8822283.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> <img id=\"img-5920929-8822283\" src=\"http://blog.goodbarber.com/photo/art/default/5920929-8822283.jpg?v=1380813419\" alt=\"How to install a domain name on my HTML5 web app?\" title=\"How to install a domain name on my HTML5 web app?\" /> </a> </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">Make it your mobile version</p> <div class=\"photo top\" style=\"text-align:center\"> <a href=\"http://blog.goodbarber.com/photo/art/grande/5920929-8822284.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> <img id=\"img-5920929-8822284\" src=\"http://blog.goodbarber.com/photo/art/default/5920929-8822284.jpg?v=1380813420\" alt=\"How to install a domain name on my HTML5 web app?\" title=\"How to install a domain name on my HTML5 web app?\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"texte\"> Once you have linked the subdomain, you will be able to retrieve a piece of code for your website.

It comes with much more content than what you have on your website. You can put in it your tweets, your facebook page, your YouTube channel, etc... and all the content you produce on the <a class=\"liens\" href=\"http://www.goodbarber.com/connectors/\">platforms that are linked to GoodBarber</a>. </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> ",

So we had time to adapt GoodBarber to the new iOS. <br /> <strong>So don't worry, all apps run well on iOS 7.</strong> </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">Is there anything they have to change ?</p> <div class=\"texte\"> <strong>On the technical side, there is nothing to do.</strong> <br /> You may notice some changes in your apps.&nbsp; <br /> For example, if you go to the submit section, and take a photo you want to upload, there is a dialogue box where you can change the size of the photo. This dialogue box is new because we use the OS dialogue. <br /> <br /> Also, if you're curious, you can go to the technical stats in your backend and see how many of your users have already switch to the iOS 7 ;) <br /> It is really interesting to check it. On the first day more than <strong>10% </strong>of readers have already switched to the new OS. <br /> </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">If our users want to make their app look good with this new design, what do they have to do?</p> <div class=\"texte\"> They can change their design and use one of our new templates. <br /> We have created flat design templates and they look very well in iOS7. <br /> It's the first thing they can do, and if they want to do that, there is no need to submit the app again. <br /> <br /> If they want to ping their users with an update, it's a good idea on the marketing side ;) <br /> They can change their app icon at the same time.&nbsp;Because with this modification you need to rebuilt your app. But it's the good time to do it.&nbsp; <br /> You can change your app icon for a flat design, it's going to look great with the iOS 7 design. </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">Jérôme, thank you so much for your answers and see you next week guys.</p> ",

But, if you create an app from scratch or with an agency, it can cost between 10K to 30K.&nbsp;In this price, I include the time to <strong>design</strong> and to <strong>developp</strong> the app. And also the time needed to <strong>manage the project</strong>. <br /> This is what an agency will charge you. </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">Is it for one platform or more?</p> <div class=\"texte\"> If you <strong>create native apps</strong>, the development for each platform is different. Sometimes you can re-use the same design, but, usually, even there, you'll have to adapt it to the look and feel of the targeted plateform. </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">Why the price is so different than the one I can get with an app builder?</p> <div class=\"texte\"> When you use an app builder, you can cut the price by 100. This is possible since thousands of people use the app builder and the small amont they pay to use it is used to develop the product. <br /> <strong>The work is done once for everybody.</strong> </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">What's the difference between an app created by an agency and an app created with an app builder?</p> <div class=\"texte\"> The approach is different. <strong>An agency</strong> will do the work <strong>just for you</strong>. They will start from your needs and ... tailor a developement for you.&nbsp; <br /> With <strong>an app builder</strong>, you will <strong>do it by yourself</strong>. Using an app builder is <strong>faster and cheaper</strong>. But your needs have to fit with the features provided by the app builder. App builders offer the possibility to create plug-ins, and this can help you if you want to add in your add something higly customized and not provided by the product.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> In both case, you'll get assistance.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> Reagrding your app updates, with an agency you'll need to pay for each update you need. Because (again), &nbsp;people will do it just for you and a team will work on your needs.&nbsp;With an app builder, and specially with GoodBarber, upadtes are included in your subscription, new features as well.&nbsp; <br /> A team is working all the time on the product. </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">So, if I understand well, the only difference is that with an app builder I create the app by myself and with an agency someone does it for me?</p> <div class=\"texte\"> Yes, exactly.&nbsp; </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">Thanks Jérôme and see you next week guys :)</p> ",

It'll in some way change the look and feel of your app when it runs on the new OS. <br /> - <strong>New standard components</strong> will also be available. We will take advantage of them in our new designs. </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">What are your users doing when they're browsing your app?</p> <div class=\"texte\"> If you have ever wanted to know what your users are doing when they are using your app, now it's possible! <br /> <br /> You're going to say: \"What? How can you know that?\" and \"What do you mean by what they are doing?\". <br /> Well, with the new&nbsp;<strong>M7 motion coprocessor</strong>, availabe in the iPhone 5S, it'll be easy to tell you if your users are running, walking, driving or not moving when they're using your app. <br /> <br /> Stationary users? Hum... as you could imagine, you may find out some of your readers have elected your app as their best companion during their ever-important breaks in the day ;) <br /> Hey! Don't get this wrong, long gone are the days of staring into space while you're sitting on the john... :) <br /> </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> ",

In each project we make, we always<strong> design</strong>&nbsp;first what we want to do. <br /> For big new features, we need to split the design process in 2 parts: <br /> - First, <strong>we draw</strong> on a notebook or a blackboard every screen of the new feature. In this phase, we <strong>focus on the user interface.</strong> Creating mockups does the job very well. <br /> - Next, when we have the mockups for every page, our <strong>designers create screenshots</strong>. They produce in photoshop the exact copy of what will be displayed on user's phones once the project is completed. In this phase we choose the look and feel and we work on all the tiny details that will <strong>make the feature look great</strong> and <strong>fun to use.</strong> </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">What's the benefit of doing the design first?</p> <div class=\"texte\"> Working on the final result first, even if we get still images after this step, is much more efficient than a litteral description. <br /> <strong>Images are better than words</strong>. But, moreover, it helps us make the right decision before we spend a lot of time developing the feature. </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">Ok, now we have design, but it's not finished yet. What's the next step?</p> <div class=\"texte\"> Next, <strong>developpers</strong> grab they keyboards and <strong>give birth to the feature.</strong> <br /> But, before they start coding, there is always a discussion between product managers, designers and the engineering team. <br /> During this discution, the engineering team give its input and most of the time we improve even more the feature. <br /> </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">Great, and when do you decide to push the feature to the users?</p> <div class=\"photo top\" style=\"text-align:center\"> <a href=\"http://blog.goodbarber.com/photo/art/grande/5824285-8683861.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> <img id=\"img-5824285-8683861\" src=\"http://blog.goodbarber.com/photo/art/default/5824285-8683861.jpg?v=1378477588\" alt=\"Friday Talk: Behind the scene, how new features are added in GoodBarber?\" title=\"Friday Talk: Behind the scene, how new features are added in GoodBarber?\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"texte\"> Before releasing the new feature, we test it with the whole team, then with a pool of <strong>beta testers</strong>.&nbsp; <br /> This is the reason why you can see sometimes in the backend, the label \"Beta\" on a menu.&nbsp; <br /> When everything is tested, it goes live and it's available to everybody. </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">My last question for you, when the next big feature will be released?</p> <div class=\"texte\"> There is a <strong>big package in the pipe right now</strong>. Before the end of the month, <strong>users will have plenty of new cool features!</strong> <br /> </div> <br class=\"clear\" /> <p class=\"intertitre\">Did you hear that guys? Stay tuned, a big thing is coming at GoodBarber!</p> ",
